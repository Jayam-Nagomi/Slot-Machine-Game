# Slot-Machine-Game

Hey!

I used python basic functions to create this small slot machine game. 
I developed this python project from scratch to get the better understanding of how to think progressively and code. 
This project changed my view about coding and ignited my journey towards a programmer.

Working:

Here I fixed it to 3 by 3 slot, you can adjust the global constant variable as you wish! 
The game here is to deposit a amount of money then bet on lines for some amount. 
Lets say we bet on 2 lines $30 each..

Then the slot rolls (I used random.choice())..

First case (Winning):

A | B | D 
A | A | A 
C | B | B

you won #30 
you won on line 2

Second case (Lost):

A | B | D 
C | D | A 
C | B | B

you lost $30

So this is how game works!
